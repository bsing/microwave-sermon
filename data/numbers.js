At this moment, all three members of the Trinity were performing three distinct activities: God the Father was speaking, God the Son was being baptized, and God the Holy Spirit was resting on the Son.",

      "The number 7 is quite significant in the Bible, appearing over 700 times throughout both the Old and New Testaments. In biblical numerology, 7 symbolizes completion or perfection. God created the world in 6 days and rested on the 7th. (Gen 2:2-3). Notable uses of 7 we can still see today is the 7 day week and the 7 colors of the rainbow.",

One example is Geneis 1:26. We also see the 10 commandments given by God and written down by Moses (Ex 20:1-17).",

The New Jerusalem, which is made in heaven and brought to the earth by God himself, contains 12 gates made of pearl that are each manned by an angel. Over each gate will be one of the names of Israel's twelve tribes.",

Nimrod, the mighty hunter who was 'before the Lord' (meaning he tried to take the place of God, Genesis 10:9), was generation 13 in Ham's line (Ham was one of Noah's three sons). 13 represents all the governments created by men, and inspired by Satan, in outright rebellion against the Eternal.",

Jacob, for 20 years, waited to get possession of his wives and property, and to be freed from the control of Laban his father-in-law (Genesis 31:38 - 41). The children of Israel, for 20 years, waited to be freed of Jabin, king of Canaan, who oppressed them.",
